Here, we provide code for replicating the simulation for our paper 'The troubling pursuit of brain biomarkers for mental health' or for experimenting with different parameters.

The code consists of two parts:
Part 1 - Technical Script (functions_260124): Here, we pre-define the simulation and plot functions, that are used (i.e., called) in the main script. Any mathematical or technical questions (i.e., how we operationalized a certain idea or construct) can be (attempted to) answer here.

Part 2 - Practical Script (simulations_260124): In this script, we define our variables of interest and simulate the data. We call our functions that we defined in the technical script. This script allows the user to play around with model parameters of interest (e.g., different vectors of brain-symptom correlations) and see how changes impact model parameters such as R squared or classification accuracy, both, on an individual, or group level.
